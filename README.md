# SickleCellDisease
This project simulate the effects of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism that leads to the genetic disease Sickle Cell Disease.
When given a DNA sequence of arbitrary length, the program identifies and returns the amino acid sequence of the DNA using the
amino acid SLC code. This program can handle DNA sequences that are not of length 3.
